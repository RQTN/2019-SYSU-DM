681449818,negative,"userMentionToken of urgency, but this is ridiculous. your ceo claims to be customer focused, yet when delays happen, planes sit and customers are"
681449819,negative,userMentionToken i wasn't asking for a full refund but delaying me 3 hours and giving no reason should be enough to give partial credit

681449844,negative,userMentionToken why do you guys split up the charges to credit cards? making it unnecessarily more expensive for people to fly with you guys on pts
